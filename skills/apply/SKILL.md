# interfluence: Apply Voice Profile

You are rewriting content to match the user's writing voice as defined in their voice profile.

## Process

1. **Resolve which voice to use:**
   - If the user provides `--voice=<name>`, use that voice
   - Otherwise, load config via `config_get` and check if it has a `voices` array
   - If it does, match the target file path against the voice patterns in order (first match wins)
   - If no match or no voices configured, use the base profile only

2. **Load the voice profile:**
   - Load the base profile: `profile_get(projectDir)`
   - If using a named voice (not base), also load the delta: `profile_get(projectDir, "<voice>")`
   - **Merge:** The delta's H2 sections override matching H2 sections in the base (matched by section title). Base sections without a matching delta section are kept as-is. Delta sections without a matching base section are appended.

3. **Read the target content:**
   - If a file path is provided, read it
   - If inline text is provided, work with that directly

4. **Rewrite the content** following the merged voice profile:
   - Preserve all factual content, technical details, and structure
   - Transform the *voice*: sentence structure, word choice, tone, formality
   - Apply the profile's sentence patterns, vocabulary preferences, and tone markers
   - Respect the anti-patterns — avoid things the author wouldn't write
   - Keep technical accuracy — don't sacrifice clarity for style

5. **Present the rewrite:**
   - Report which voice was used and why: "Applied blog voice to posts/new-post.md (matched pattern 'posts/**')" or "Applied base voice (no matching pattern found)"
   - Show the rewritten version
   - Briefly note 2-3 specific voice adaptations you made (e.g., "Changed prescriptive 'You should' to first-person 'I find'")
   - Ask if the user wants to apply it to the file or make adjustments

6. **Apply changes** if the user approves

## H2 Section Merge Algorithm

When merging base + delta profiles:

1. Parse both into H2-keyed sections: `## Section Title` → everything until the next `##` or EOF
2. Start with all base sections in order
3. For each delta section: if a base section has the same `## Title`, replace it. If not, append the delta section at the end.
4. The merged result is your working voice profile for this rewrite.

## Important
- NEVER change the meaning or technical accuracy of content
- The goal is to make it sound like the user wrote it, not to "improve" it
- When in doubt about a stylistic choice, err toward the user's natural patterns
- If the content is already close to the user's voice, say so — don't force unnecessary changes
- For long documents, work section by section to maintain quality
